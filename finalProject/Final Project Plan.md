# Final Project Plan

## Intro and Background

Social network websites have gained huge popularities in the past tens years. Websites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn almost become a necessity in our daily lives, with the help mobile phones. Ordinaries share their  moments of lives, keep update from their friends, learn and share news all over the world from the networks. Politicians share their polices and communicate with supports on the networks. Professionals share their skills and experience or connect with each other on the networks. I will say those networks, that we built together, are priceless assets of information and data. And by analyzing and digging the data (posts, pictures, likes and sharing, surprising observation and deep buries trend can be found. The journals provided are simply fantastic examples of data mining and analysis. 

As a heavy user of all the websites mentioned above, I think it will be fun to dig out some interesting information from my Facebook friends, posts or from some news pages and celebrities' account.  

## Packages and Tools 

__Rfacebook: Access to Facebook API via R__
Rfacebook is a package provides a series of functions that allow R users to access Facebook's API to get information about public pages, groups, and posts, as well as some of the authenticated user's private data.

__ggplot2: Data Visualization with R__  
Ggplot2 is package that allows researchers in social sciences to easily create elegant and effective graphs.

## Targeted observations
### Analyzing my own network of friends 
Function ``getFriends()`` returns Facebook user's information from his friends and ``getUsers()`` returns data frame with users' Facebook data, including relationship status, hometown and locations. In this case, a simple network graph can be made given the location. Also it is interesting to find out the age distribution of my Facebook friends.

### Analyzing public Facebook pages like Vox
Vox is always one of my favorite new pages on Facebook. By using function ``getPosts()`` , ``getLikes()`` and ``getReactions()``, I can easily find out how people react to different policies and topics on Vox. and By further analyzing the age and location distribution of people, more useful information will be digger out.
